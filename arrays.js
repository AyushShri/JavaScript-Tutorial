                                                           Arrays
Arrays are lists of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type. 
Arrays are created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

// An array containing numbers
const numberArray = [0, 1, 2, 3];

// An array containing different data types
const mixedArray = [1, 'chicken', false];
Index
Array elements are arranged by index values, starting at 0 as the first element index. Elements can be accessed by their index using the array name, and the index surrounded by square brackets.

// Accessing an array element
const myArray = [100, 200, 300];

console.log(myArray[0]); // 100
console.log(myArray[1]); // 200
console.log(myArray[2]); // 300
